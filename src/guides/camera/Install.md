## Overview

This guide will help you correctly install a camera to use with LightBurn. If your laser came with a camera already mounted, you can skip ahead to [Camera calibration](#).

This guide focuses on the most common setups. If this doesn't match what you're doing, please see [additional info](#) about different camera setups.

## What you'll need

- Access to your laser
- A camera
- A suitable mount

## Steps

Show steps for mounting a camera. Use pictures/animated gifs/videos as well as text. [Prusa's guides](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbed-thermistor-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mk2s_19272) are a pretty good example. Ideally, we'd handle variants in an easier-to-follow way (see step 4 and 5 in the link), probably through tabs if changes are minor, or separate guides if there are huge differences.
