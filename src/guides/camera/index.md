LightBurn can use a camera for tracing images and helping you place your designs more easily. If you have a camera for your laser or are thinking of getting one, the guides below can help you with choosing, setting up, and using a camera with LightBurn.

## Camera Setup

To use a camera with your laser, you'll need to select and mount a camera (unless it was pre-installed) and use our [camera calibration](#) and [alignment](#) wizards for a more accurate view of the inside of your laser.

For more help with the process:
