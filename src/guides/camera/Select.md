## Overview

This guide will help you select a camera. If your laser came with a camera already mounted, you can skip ahead to [Camera calibration](#).

This guide focuses on selecting one of the [official LightBurn cameras](https://lightburnsoftware.com/collections/cameras), which have been tested to work across a variety of setups. If you want to use a different camera, we have [additional compatibility info](#) for you.

## What you'll need

- Access to your laser
- A ruler
- A working copy of LightBurn

## Steps

Show steps for selecting a camera. Use pictures/animated gifs/videos as well as text. [Prusa's guides](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbed-thermistor-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mk2s_19272) are a pretty good example. Ideally, we'd handle variants in an easier-to-follow way (see step 4 and 5 in the link), probably through tabs if changes are minor, or separate guides if there are huge differences.
