## Overview

This guide will help you align your camera.

If you're using one of the [official LightBurn cameras](https://lightburnsoftware.com/collections/cameras), you can use the presets and skip the rest of this step.

## What you'll need

- Access to your laser
- A piece of scrap material for the alignment grid
- A working copy of LightBurn

## Steps

Show steps for selecting a camera. Use pictures/animated gifs/videos as well as text. [Prusa's guides](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-replace-a-heatbed-thermistor-mk3s-mk3s-mk2-5s-mk2s_19272) are a pretty good example. Ideally, we'd handle variants in an easier-to-follow way (see step 4 and 5 in the link), probably through tabs if changes are minor, or separate guides if there are huge differences.
