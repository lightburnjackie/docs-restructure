## Internal notes

This will be a step by step **beginner** walkthrough of getting a trial key and installing LightBurn. This should **link to** an explanation of pricing and info on purchasing a license, but should only include getting a trial key in the text. Include a note on what to do if the user doesn't see the trial key in email.
