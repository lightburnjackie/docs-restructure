## Templates

We're going to keep templates as consistent as possible within a type

- [Sample tutorial]({{ './sampletutorial' | url }})
- [Sample guide]({{ './sampleguide' | url }})
- [Sample project]({{ './sampleproject' | url }})
- [Sample quickref card]({{ './samplequickref' | url }})
- [Sample feature page]({{ './samplefeaturepage' | url }})
- [Sample troubleshooting](#)

- machine/license type (should these be separated?)
- release info
- content type (guide, tutorial, etc)
