# Documentation Restructuring

## About

This is a test site for figuring out how we want to restructure the documentation. Styling is very minimal right now. It's currently based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), with Bootstrap for layout and styling.

## Setup

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= version 14. Install in whatever way is appropriate for your computer

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. From the root of the repository, run `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running Locally
To run the development server, run `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`. 

The dev server will automatically reload when you make changes. You can also access it from other devices connected to the same network (see the messages in the console for more info)

## Pushing changes to GitHub Pages
1. Commit your changes
2. Push to the `main` branch
3. Check on GitHub that it built successfully.

## Notes

- Layouts are going to be changing pretty frequently for now
- If you have suggestions for changes you'd like to see, please let me know
